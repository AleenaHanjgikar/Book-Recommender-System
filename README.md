# 📚 Book Recommender System

A content-based book recommendation system built using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and machine learning techniques. This project recommends similar books based on a selected book's title using cosine similarity on book features like title, author, and genre.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Recommend top similar books based on input
- Uses content-based filtering with cosine similarity
- Clean UI using Streamlit (optional)
- Interactive user experience

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 How It Works

1. Loads book dataset
2. Preprocesses data (lowercasing, removing NaNs, etc.)
3. Combines important book features
4. Transforms the data using `CountVectorizer`
5. Computes cosine similarity matrix
6. Recommends books based on user selection

✨ Future Improvements:

Deploy with Streamlit or Flask

Integrate external book APIs for real-time data
